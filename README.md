This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.4.

## Problem Statement
1. Create a form with 3 inputs: 1 dropdown field, a field that will input the value for
the date, and a button.
2. The dropdown field values should display on initialization using services.
3. The input and the dropdown fields should use Two-Way Binding. Create a model
for the fields and initialize them on ngOnInit()
4. Create a service for sending the data and retrieving the data.
5. Create a function which will bind with the (ngSubmit). Once you click on the button,
it should send the data in the parameter and it should display the data in View. Use
pipe to show the date in 9/3/2010 this format.
6. Use the JSON pipe to see the form value and the dropdown value should display
in uppercase in View.
